Academic writing involves writing, storing, sharing and retrieving
documents which are essential for a workflow of academic research. In
addition to you documents you have to manage external files like images
or bibliography.

For that, many authors rely on Word Processors like Microsoft Word or
Google Docs. Alternatively you could use open source software
Libreoffice Writer, but it is not commonly used as Word. So .odt format
is not often used and sometimes .docx files are not rendered correctly
in Writer.

As an alternative (\LaTeX) is powerful
